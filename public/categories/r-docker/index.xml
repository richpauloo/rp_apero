      <description>Salvador Dali, &amp;ldquo;The Persistence of Memory&amp;rdquo; 1931.
Introduction   Although Docker has been around for years, Docker in the data science community doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem as widespread as git, which I attribute to the fact that many data scientists learn to program and work independently. However, as data scientists increasingly collaborate with others or aim to make their work more reproducible, Docker deserves an equal place alongside git in the practitioner&amp;rsquo;s toolkit.</description>
