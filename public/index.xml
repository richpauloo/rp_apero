      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites     Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Salvador Dali, &amp;ldquo;The Disintegration of The Persistence of Memory&amp;rdquo; 1952.
Introduction   My mother grew up as the youngest of 6 children in Thailand, after her family emigrated from China during the Chinese Civil Wars. While growing up in Bangkok&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown, my mother learned English from Christian missionaries, and eventually immigrated to the United States.
First a devout Buddhist, and later a devout Christian, my mom&amp;rsquo;s core values have always included love and compassion.</description>

      <description>Salvador Dali, &amp;ldquo;The Persistence of Memory&amp;rdquo; 1931.
Introduction   Although Docker has been around for years, Docker in the data science community doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem as widespread as git, which I attribute to the fact that many data scientists learn to program and work independently. However, as data scientists increasingly collaborate with others or aim to make their work more reproducible, Docker deserves an equal place alongside git in the practitioner&amp;rsquo;s toolkit.</description>

      <description>French tapestry, &amp;ldquo;Jesuits performing astronomy with Chinese&amp;rdquo;
Introduction     As opposed to traditional row-based storage (e.g., SQL), Parquet files (.parquet) are columnar-based, and feature efficient compression (fast read/write and small disk usage) and optimized performance for big data. Writing to parquet data format and partitioning (splitting the data across multiple files for faster querying) is relatively trivial in R with the {arrow} package which provides arrow::write_dataset(). There are a few options for querying Parquet data from R.</description>

      <description>After years of investigation, the Department of Justice released a redacted copy of the Mueller Report on Thursday April 18, 2019. A simple sentiment analysis reveals the report is incredibly negative. Honing in on positive sections is misleading, as they concern the infamous loyaltly conversations with Comey.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: I am so honored to have won an award in the 2018 CA Water Data Challenge! You can view the wining project here.
After graduate school, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably apply to as many jobs as I can and see what sticks. But deep down, a career that integrates my domain knowledge of groundwater and California water with the broad field of data science is what I seek.
So when the California Water Data Challenge was announced earlier this year, I was pretty excited.</description>
