description: Chuang Tzu once warned, "_Your life has a limit, but knowledge has none. If you use what is limited to pursue what has no limit, you will be in danger_." I didn't understand this until midway through a PhD. I was building computer simulations of how water flows underground, how contaminants advect and disperse through rocks. I was far and away, on a slippery slope towards the infinite. These days, I'm more at peace with all I'll never learn. I try to learn about others, about myself, about the bewildering world we live in. I like to puzzle over how we fit together, what we can accomplish together, what it's all about. As the 53rd Calypso of _The Books of Bokonon_ remind us, "_Nice, nice, very nice -- / So many different people / In the same device._" My maternal Chinese surname is _æž—_ (the characters represent 2 trees and mean _forest_). My paternal surname is Pauloo, Americanized at Ellis Island from the Polish "Paulowski".
