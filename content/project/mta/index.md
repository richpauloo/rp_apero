New York Cityâ€™s public transit system is a lifeline for millions, including seniors and low-income residents who rely on it for daily commutes, errands, and access to essential services. Understanding how these populations use the subway system is vital for ensuring that transit services remain accessible, equitable, and responsive to their needs.

This accessibility analysis aims to shed light on ridership patterns, particularly among seniors and Fair Fare riders (low-income individuals who qualify for reduced fare programs). By studying the spatial patterns of subway ridership relative to the demographics of surrounding neighborhoods, we can uncover critical insights into how well the MTA serves vulnerable populations and where opportunities for strategic intervention might exist. These insights will enable the MTA to allocate resources more effectively, improve accessibility where it is most needed, and ensure that no community is left behind in the provision of transit services.
