<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I've spent the pas 12 years as an educator, researcher, and data scientist. I currently scope and manage the delivery of data science and software projects at [Accenture](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpauloo/). I co-founded the [Water Data Lab](https://www.waterdatalab.com), helped create [R for Water Resources Data Science](https://www.r4wrds.com), and [blog](/blog) about my adventures in data.  

I love to surf 🏄, climb mountains 🧗, read and learn new things 📚, play guitar 🎸, and cook 🍳.
