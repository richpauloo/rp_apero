  I've spent the past 12 years as an educator, researcher, data scientist, and project/product manager. Currently, I scope and manage the delivery of data science and software projects/products at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpauloo/" target="_blank">Accenture</a>. In addition, I co-founded the <a href="https://www.waterdatalab.com" target="_blank">Water Data Lab</a>, helped create <a href="https://www.r4wrds.com" target="_blank">R for Water Resources Data Science</a>, and occasionally [write](/blog).  

  Through my consulting practice -- a blend of water resources, data science, and technology -- I've developed <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6f10" target="_blank">models</a> that predict where wells will go dry during drought and <a href="https://www.gspdrywells.com/" target="_blank">web applications</a> to communicate findings, automated reports of California municipal <a href="https://www.calwaterquality.com" target="_blank">water quality</a>, and the nation's largest publicly-accessible spatial database of <a href="https://github.com/SimpleLab-Inc/wsb" target="_blank">water system spatial boundaries</a>.  
  
  I grew up off-the-grid in the high desert hills and boulder fields of Southern California and moved to Berkeley for college where I studied Biology and Conflict Resolution. Then, I spent 3 unforgettable years in educational nonprofits in Yosemite, the Marin Headlands, and the Santa Cruz mountains. During summers, I led trips in Thailand for National Geographic. For the next 5 years during my PhD,  I built 3D, physics-based and statistical models of subsurface groundwater flow and contaminant transport, supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy, NASA, and Microsoft. I then helped develop groundwater sustainability plans in California, which entailed coordination of diverse stakeholder groups, technical project management, IoT monitoring, and mathematical modeling. Now, I consult for energy and water utilities, startups, and environmental nonprofits at the intersection of resource management, data governance, and technology.  
  
  My home base is in Oakland, California. I love to surf, ski, climb mountains, read and learn new things, play guitar, and cook.
