  Here are some words that describe me in the dim, reducing light that only nouns can cast -- writer, reader, scientist, programmer, educator, strategist -- but the best way to get to know me is to in-person, preferably on a walk or over a cup of matcha.
  
  Currently I lead data science and software teams in the energy sector. We build tools to help utilities make better decisions for climate resilience and electrification. My work has appeared in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-41379-9" target="_blank">Nature</a>, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-12-16/its-a-race-to-the-bottom-for-agricultural-wells" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264206-groundwater-that-supports-world-food-chain-may-become-too-salty-to-use/" target="_blank">NewScientist</a>, and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/california-drought-rain-reservoirs-groundwater-1772590" target="_blank">Newsweek</a>.

  My practice is at intersection of water resources, energy, strategy, policy, utilities, climate change, data science, and technology. I've developed <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6f10" target="_blank">models</a> that predict where wells will go dry during drought, and <a href="https://www.gspdrywells.com/" target="_blank">web applications</a> for visual communication. I've automated California municipal <a href="https://www.calwaterquality.com" target="_blank">water quality reports</a>, helped build the nation's largest publicly-accessible spatial database of <a href="https://github.com/SimpleLab-Inc/wsb" target="_blank">water system spatial boundaries</a>, and co-founded the <a href="https://www.waterdatalab.com" target="_blank">Water Data Lab</a>, a group within <a href="https://www.convolve.coop" target="_blank">Convolve Coperative</a>. I also co-developed <a href="https://www.r4wrds.com" target="_blank">R for Water Resources Data Science</a>, and I occasionally [write about data](/blog). 
  
  Here are a few notable life moments that are perhaps worth sharing. I grew up off-the-grid in the high desert hills and boulder fields of Southern California. Our closest neighbors lived 5 miles away. It was quiet childhood, and I read a lot of books. I ran with my dogs through the tall yellow mustard when it bloomed in the spring. And yet, my childhood wasn't exactly idyllic. When I turned 7, my mom became a single parent. She was an immigrant without a college education -- as tough as they come, and then some. We moved a lot. She was always working, always behind. I learned a lot from her. When I was 17, I moved to Berkeley and studied Biology and Conflict Resolution. I had the honor of delivering my departmental commencement speech in the Greek Theater, on the same stage where, as a student, I'd seen the Dalai Lama and Yo-Yo Ma. Of course, I gave a far less compelling performance. After college, I taught environmental science at educational nonprofits in Yosemite, the Marin Headlands, and the Santa Cruz mountains. During summers, I led trips in Thailand for National Geographic. Somewhere along the way, I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life learning, and I was fortunate to have the privilege to do so. While working towards a PhD, I built 3D, physics-based and statistical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. I also learned how to skate down parking structures -- a wonderful way to clear the mind while running long computer simulations back at the lab. Big ups to the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy, NASA, and Microsoft, all of whom funded my work in some way. After grad school, I helped develop 6 groundwater sustainability plans in California, all of which passed state-level environmental review (thank goodness), and which entailed the coordination of diverse stakeholder groups, technical project management, IoT monitoring, and mathematical modeling. Now, I consult for energy and water utilities, startups, and environmental nonprofits. I make an effort to listen, and I try hard at this, because my inclination is to talk too much. 
  
  Work is something we do, but it's not who we are. When I wake up in the morning, I like to write. Before I go to sleep, I like to read. I believe that rest is critical to creativity. I strive to do nothing strenuous from Friday evening to Saturday evening. I used to climb mountains with gear, ropes, and rubber-rimmed footwear, but now I like flat ground (rolling hills are also nice). I've given up trying to predict where I will be in 5 years, because I consistently surprise myself and end up somewhere else delightful. And so, I'm trying instead to be present, kind, and helpful. Few things satisfy me more than a good book, sharing a home cooked meal with friends and family, listening to practiced musicians improvise, or feeling like I'm making the world a slightly better place to live in. It's not bad, but it could be better. I believe that out there on the margins, on the fringes, and within those places inside oneself that are silent but knowable, is where we find the exciting and important work; and we have so much work to do, so much ground to cover.
