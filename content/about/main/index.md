  Here are some words that describe me in the dim, reducing light that only nouns can cast -- writer, reader, scientist, programmer, educator, strategist -- but the best way to get to know me is to in-person, preferably on a walk or over a cup of matcha.
  
  Currently I lead data science and software teams in the energy sector. We build tools to help utilities make better decisions for climate resilience and electrification. 

  My practice is at intersection of water and energy resources, strategy, policy, utilities, climate change, data science, and technology. I've developed <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6f10" target="_blank">models</a> that predict where wells will go dry during drought, and <a href="https://www.gspdrywells.com/" target="_blank">web applications</a> for visual communication, I've automated California municipal <a href="https://www.calwaterquality.com" target="_blank">water quality reports</a>, and I've built the nation's largest publicly-accessible spatial database of <a href="https://github.com/SimpleLab-Inc/wsb" target="_blank">water system spatial boundaries</a>. In addition, I co-founded the <a href="https://www.waterdatalab.com" target="_blank">Water Data Lab</a> a group within <a href="https://www.convolve.coop" target="_blank">Convolve Cooperative</a>, helped create <a href="https://www.r4wrds.com" target="_blank">R for Water Resources Data Science</a>, and I occasionally [write about data](/blog).  
  
  Here are a few notable life moments that are perhaps worth sharing. I grew up off-the-grid in the high desert hills and boulder fields of Southern California. Our closest neighbors lived 5 miles away. It was quiet and I read a lot of books. I ran with my dogs through the tall mustard when it bloomed in spring. And yet, my childhood wasn't exactly idyllic. When I turned 7, my mom became a single parent. She was an immigrant, without a college education, as tough as they come, and then some. We moved a lot. She was always working, always behind. I learned a lot from her. When I was 17, I moved to Berkeley and studied Biology and Conflict Resolution. Then, I taught environmental science at educational nonprofits in Yosemite, the Marin Headlands, and the Santa Cruz mountains. During summers, I led trips in Thailand for National Geographic. Somewhere along the way, I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life learning, and I was fortunate to have the privilege to do so. While working towards a PhD, I built 3D, physics-based and statistical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. I also learned how to skate down parking structures -- a wonderful way to clear the mind while computer simulations are running back at the lab. Big ups to the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy, NASA, and Microsoft, all of whom funded my work in some way. After grad school, I helped develop 6 groundwater sustainability plans in California, all of which passed environmental review (thank goodness), and which entailed the coordination of diverse stakeholder groups, technical project management, IoT monitoring, and mathematical modeling. Now, I consult for energy and water utilities, startups, and environmental nonprofits at the intersection of resource management, data governance, and technology. I make an effort to listen, and need to try hard at this, because my inclination is to talk too much. 
  
  Work is something we do, but it's not who we are. When I wake up in the mornings, I like to write. Before I go to sleep, I like to read. I believe that rest is critical to creativity. I strive to do nothing strenuous from Friday evening to Saturday evening. I used to climb mountains with gear and ropes and rubber-rimmed footwear, but now I like the water and the flat ground. I've given up trying to predict where I will be in 5 years, because I consistently surprise myself and end up somewhere else delightful. And so, I'm trying instead to be present, kind, and helpful. Nothing satisfies me more than learning something new, sharing a home cooked meal with friends and family, and finding some moment of kindness and truth in an otherwise random, cold universe. It's not bad, but it could be better. I believe that out there on the margins, on the fringes, and within those places inside oneself that are silent but knowable, is where we find the exciting and important work. And we have so much work to do, and ground to cover.
