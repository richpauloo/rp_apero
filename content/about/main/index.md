  I've spent the past 12 years as an educator, researcher, and data scientist. Currently, I scope and manage the delivery of data science and software projects at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpauloo/" target="_blank">Accenture</a>. In addition, I co-founded the <a href="https://www.waterdatalab.com" target="_blank">Water Data Lab</a>, helped create <a href="https://www.r4wrds.com" target="_blank">R for Water Resources Data Science</a>, and occasionally post to my [blog](/blog).  

  I grew up off-the-grid in the high desert hills and boulder fields of Southern California; in the absence of television and close neighbors, I read voraciously. I moved to Berkeley for college where I studied Biology and Conflict Resolution. Then I spent 3 unforgettable years in educational nonprofits in Yosemite, the Marin Headlands, and the Santa Cruz mountains. During summers, I led trips in Thailand for National Geographic. For the next 5 years, I worked on a PhD in Hydrogeology, and built 3D, physics-based and statistical models of subsurface groundwater flow and contaminant transport, supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy, NASA, and Microsoft (among other funding sources). I then helped develop groundwater sustainability plans for six groundwater basins in California, which entailed coordination of diverse stakeholder groups, technical project management, IoT monitoring, and mathematical modeling. 
  
  Through my consulting practice -- a blend of water resources, data science, and web technology -- I've developed <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6f10" target="_blank">models</a> that predict where wells will go dry during drought and <a href="https://www.gspdrywells.com/" target="_blank">web interfaces</a> to communicate findings, an app to quickly find look up California municipal <a href="https://www.calwaterquality.com" target="_blank">water quality</a>, and the nation's largest publicly-accessible spatial database of <a href="https://github.com/SimpleLab-Inc/wsb" target="_blank">water system spatial boundaries</a>.  
  
  My home base is in Oakland, California. I love to surf 🏄, climb mountains 🧗, read and learn new things 📚, play guitar 🎸, and cook 🍳.
