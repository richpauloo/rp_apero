  I work at the intersection of data science, hydrology, and climate to measure and model the water and energy systems that sustain humanity. My expertise spans modeling, geospatial programming, and natural resource management.

  During my career, I've:  

  - Built 3D models to predict <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020WR028655" target="_blank">groundwater flow</a> and <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023WR035446" target="_blank">contaminant transport</a> in aquifers critical to global food and water supply.  
  - Developed <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6f10" target="_blank">regional-scale models</a> to predict drought-driven well failures, with a focus on disadvantaged communities.  
  - Created interactive, geospatial <a href="https://www.gspdrywells.com/" target="_blank">decision-support tools</a> to inform sustainable resource management.  

  Iâ€™ve also automated municipal <a href="https://www.calwaterquality.com" target="_blank">water quality reports</a> in California and co-developed the nationâ€™s largest public spatial database of <a href="https://www.policyinnovation.org/technology/water-utility-service-area-boundaries" target="_blank">water system boundaries</a>, now used by the US EPA. As co-founder of Water Data Lab, I've trained 400+ scientists and engineers through the <a href="https://www.r4wrds.com" target="_blank">R for Water Resources Data Science</a> curriculum.  

  My work has been featured in <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/water-whiplash-5ficzw/" target="_blank">PBS</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-41379-9" target="_blank">Nature</a>, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-12-16/its-a-race-to-the-bottom-for-agricultural-wells" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a>, and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264206-groundwater-that-supports-world-food-chain-may-become-too-salty-to-use/" target="_blank">NewScientist</a>. I lead Innovation teams that build technology for electric utilities. 

  When time permits, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and science communication. My early career included teaching environmental science to 5th graders and leading National Geographic expeditions in Thailand for high school students.

  <!--
  Here are a few notable life moments that are perhaps worth sharing. I grew up off-the-grid in the high desert hills and boulder fields of Southern California. Our closest neighbors lived 5 miles away and we didn't have a television. It was quiet childhood, and I read a lot of books. I ran with my dogs through the tall yellow mustard when it bloomed in the spring. And then, when I was 7, my mom suddenly became a single parent. She's an immigrant from Thailand, without a college education, and after all these years, still the strongest person I know. Her parents, also immigrants, came to Thailand by way of China, in retreat of the rising Communist State. When I was 17, I moved to Berkeley and studied Biology and Conflict Resolution. I had the honor of delivering my departmental commencement speech in the Greek Theater, on the same stage where, as a student, I'd seen the Dalai Lama and Yo-Yo Ma. Of course, my performance was so much tinier in so many ways, but it was thrilling to hear a few thousand people chuckle at my bits. After college, I taught environmental science at an educational nonprofit in Yosemite and the Marin Headlands. During summers, I led trips in Thailand for National Geographic. Somewhere along the way, I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life learning, and I was fortunate to have the privilege to do so. While working towards a PhD, I built 3D, physics-based and statistical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. I also learned how to skateboard down parking structures -- a wonderful way to clear the mind while running long computer simulations back at the lab. Big ups to the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy, NASA, and Microsoft, all of whom funded my work in some way. After grad school, I helped develop 6 groundwater sustainability plans in California, all of which passed state-level environmental review (thank goodness), and which entailed the coordination of diverse stakeholder groups, technical project management, IoT monitoring, and mathematical modeling. 

  
  When I wake in the morning, I like to write. Before I sleep, I like to read. I believe that rest is critical to creativity. I strive to do nothing strenuous from Friday evening to Saturday evening. I used to climb steep, alpine rock faces with gear, ropes, and rubber-rimmed footwear, but that's increasingly outside of my risk tolerance. I've given up trying to predict exactly where I will be in 5 to 10 years, because I consistently surprise myself and end up somewhere else delightful. And so, instead, I'm trying to be present, kind, and helpful. Few things satisfy me more than a good book, sharing a home cooked meal with friends and family, listening to practiced musicians improvise, or finding small ways to make the world a slightly better place to live in. It's not bad, but it could be better. I believe that out there on the margins, on the fringes, is where we find the exciting and important work; and we have so much work to do, so much ground to cover.
