  I'm broadly interested in advancing methods to measure, model, and manage the complex water and energy systems that sustain large human populations. My expertise is at the intersection of mathematical/statistical modeling, hydrogeology, geospatial programming, data science/engineering, climate change, and environmental policy. 
  
  I've built 3D computational fluid dynamics models to explain and predict patterns of <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020WR028655" target="_blank">groundwater flow</a> and <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023WR035446" target="_blank">contaminant transport</a> in heterogeneous, alluvial aquifer-aquitard complexes -- thin layers of subsurface, freshwater-bearing sediment that support food supply and civilization, and which are in decline worldwide. I've also developed the first <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6f10" target="_blank">regional-scale models</a> that predict the location and intensity of well failures due to drought and unsustainable water management, and which tend to disproportionately impact DACs/DVCs that depend on relatively shallow wells. Because the sustainable management of complex, heavily-used, and regulated systems of natural resources typically hinge on available information, I've also built online <a href="https://www.gspdrywells.com/" target="_blank">decision-support tools</a> that leverage interactive data visualization and geospatial interfaces to tell stories and highlight tradeoffs. I've automated California municipal <a href="https://www.calwaterquality.com" target="_blank">water quality reports</a> and co-developed the nation's largest publicly-accessible spatial database of <a href="https://github.com/SimpleLab-Inc/wsb" target="_blank">water system spatial boundaries</a> (now in use by the US EPA). I co-founded the <a href="https://www.waterdatalab.com" target="_blank">Water Data Lab</a>, a group within <a href="https://www.convolve.coop" target="_blank">Convolve Collective</a> and I also co-developed and teach <a href="https://www.r4wrds.com" target="_blank">R for Water Resources Data Science</a>.  
  
  My work has appeared in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-41379-9" target="_blank">Nature</a>, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-12-16/its-a-race-to-the-bottom-for-agricultural-wells" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264206-groundwater-that-supports-world-food-chain-may-become-too-salty-to-use/" target="_blank">NewScientist</a>, and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/california-drought-rain-reservoirs-groundwater-1772590" target="_blank">Newsweek</a>.
  
  Currently, I lead research and development initiatives in the energy sector. We build tools to help electric utilities adapt to climate change, assess wildfire risk, and make equitable electrification investments. When I have the time, I still enjoy contributing to literature and to open source projects. Long ago, I taught environmental science to 5th graders and led National Geographic expeditions for high school students.

  Here are a few notable life moments that are perhaps worth sharing. I grew up off-the-grid in the high desert hills and boulder fields of Southern California. Our closest neighbors lived 5 miles away and we didn't have a television. It was quiet childhood, and I read a lot of books. I ran with my dogs through the tall yellow mustard when it bloomed in the spring. And then, when I was 7, my mom suddenly became a single parent. She's an immigrant from Thailand, without a college education, and after all these years, still the strongest person I know. Her parents, also immigrants, came to Thailand by way of China, in retreat of the rising Communist State. When I was 17, I moved to Berkeley and studied Biology and Conflict Resolution. I had the honor of delivering my departmental commencement speech in the Greek Theater, on the same stage where, as a student, I'd seen the Dalai Lama and Yo-Yo Ma. Of course, my performance was so much tinier in so many ways, but it was thrilling to hear a few thousand people chuckle at my bits. After college, I taught environmental science at an educational nonprofit in Yosemite and the Marin Headlands. During summers, I led trips in Thailand for National Geographic. Somewhere along the way, I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life learning, and I was fortunate to have the privilege to do so. While working towards a PhD, I built 3D, physics-based and statistical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. I also learned how to skateboard down parking structures -- a wonderful way to clear the mind while running long computer simulations back at the lab. Big ups to the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy, NASA, and Microsoft, all of whom funded my work in some way. After grad school, I helped develop 6 groundwater sustainability plans in California, all of which passed state-level environmental review (thank goodness), and which entailed the coordination of diverse stakeholder groups, technical project management, IoT monitoring, and mathematical modeling. 

  
  When I wake in the morning, I like to write. Before I sleep, I like to read. I believe that rest is critical to creativity. I strive to do nothing strenuous from Friday evening to Saturday evening. I used to climb steep, alpine rock faces with gear, ropes, and rubber-rimmed footwear, but that's increasingly outside of my risk tolerance. I've given up trying to predict exactly where I will be in 5 to 10 years, because I consistently surprise myself and end up somewhere else delightful. And so, instead, I'm trying to be present, kind, and helpful. Few things satisfy me more than a good book, sharing a home cooked meal with friends and family, listening to practiced musicians improvise, or finding small ways to make the world a slightly better place to live in. It's not bad, but it could be better. I believe that out there on the margins, on the fringes, is where we find the exciting and important work; and we have so much work to do, so much ground to cover.
