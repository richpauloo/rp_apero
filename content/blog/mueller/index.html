title: Text analysis of the Mueller Report
author: Rich
summary: 'After years of investigation, the Department of Justice released a redacted copy of the Mueller Report on Thursday April 18, 2019. A simple sentiment analysis reveals the report is incredibly negative. Honing in on positive sections is misleading, as they concern the infamous loyaltly conversations with Comey.'

<p>After years of investigation, the Department of Justice released <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/full-mueller-report-pdf/index.html">a redacted copy of the Mueller Report</a> on Thursday April 18, 2019. The report weighs in at a hefty 448 pages, and covers everything from Russian interference in 2016 presidential election, to the private testimony of Michael Cohen, and whether or not President Trump may have obstructed justice.</p>
<p>I don’t have all day to read this report, but I am interested to see what I can learn in a short afternoon by scraping the report and doing a cursory text and sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>I’m going to rely on two main packages: <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools"><code>pdftools</code></a> for scraping the text of the report, and <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/"><code>tidytext</code></a> for general text mining functions.</p>

## investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry. Even if the removal
## of the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation from continuing under a new appointee,
## a factfinder would need to consider whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the
## investigation, chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel, or otherwise impede the
## investigation.
## 
##         A threshold question is whether the President in fact directed McGahn to have the Special
## Counsel removed. After news organizations reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered
## McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly disputed these accounts, and
## privately told McGahn that he had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the
## Department of Justice’s attention. See Volume II, Section II.I, infra. Some of the President’s
## specific language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that explanation.
## Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact
## directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed.
## 
##          First, McGahn’s clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein
## not only that conflicts existed but also that “Mueller has to go.” McGahn is a credible witness
## with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.601 McGahn
## spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it
## unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President’s request. In response to that request,
## McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin
## to the Saturday Night Massacre. He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his
## office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President
## had asked him to “do crazy shit,” and informed Priebus and Bannon that he was leaving. Those
## acts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of
## Justice.
## 
##         Second, in the days before the calls to McGahn, the President, through his counsel, had
## already brought the asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice. Accordingly,
## the President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues
## that already had been raised.
## 
##         Third, the President’s sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate
## action on a weekend—“You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.”—support McGahn’s recollection
## that the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel.
## Had the President instead sought only to have the Department of Justice re-examine asserted
## conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the
## process in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn.
## 
##         Finally, the President had discussed “knocking out Mueller” and raised conflicts of interest
## in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan
## to remove the Special Counsel. And in the days leading up to June 17, 2017, the President made
## clear to Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the President was considering terminating
## 
##         601
##            When this Office first interviewed McGahn about this topic, he was reluctant to share detailed
## information about what had occurred and only did so after continued questioning. See McGahn 12/14/17
## 302 (agent notes).

<p>Let’s do some light cleaning and formatting: tokenize all words, index the postion of each word within its page and the document overall, remove stop words, and remove numeric tokens.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>text_df &lt;- tibble(page = 1:length(d), text = d)

<p>Now, I join sentiment scores (either positive or negative) for every word in the doc, using the sentiment lexicon from <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html">Bing Liu and collaborators</a>, calculate the number of positive and negative words on each page, and normalize this score across the document. I had to remove the string “trump” because it’s used so much in the document, and actually classifies as a positive word, which is misleading.

## That plan, Manafort later acknowledged, constituted a “backdoor” means for Russia to control

<blockquote>
<p>“[a]s used in [S]ection 1505, the term ‘corruptly’ means acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another, including by making a false or misleading statement, or withholding, concealing, altering, or destroying a document or other information.</p>

## 
## Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 599-602. In several obstruction cases, the Court has imposed a nexus test that
## requires that the wrongful conduct targeted by the provision be sufficiently connected to an official
## proceeding to ensure the requisite culpability. Marinello, 138 S. Ct. at 1109; Arthur Andersen,
## 544 U.S. at 707-708; Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600-602. Section 1512(c)(2) has been interpreted to
## require a similar nexus. See, e.g., United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019);
## United States v. Petruk, 781 F.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d
## 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). To satisfy
## the nexus requirement, the government must show as an objective matter that a defendant acted
## “in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,” such that the statute “excludes defendants who have
## an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful.”
## Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id. at 599 (“the endeavor
## must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice”)
## (internal quotation marks omitted). The government must also show as a subjective matter that
## the actor “contemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding.” Petruk, 781 F.3d at 445. Those
## requirements alleviate fair-warning concerns by ensuring that obstructive conduct has a close
## enough connection to existing or future proceedings to implicate the dangers targeted by the
## obstruction laws and that the individual actually has the obstructive result in mind.
## 
##         b. Courts also seek to construe statutes to avoid due process vagueness concerns. See, e.g.,
## McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2016); Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358,
## 368, 402-404 (2010). Vagueness doctrine requires that a statute define a crime “with sufficient
## definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited” and “in a manner that
## does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Id. at 402-403 (internal quotation
## marks omitted). The obstruction statutes’ requirement of acting “corruptly” satisfies that test.
## 
##         “Acting ‘corruptly’ within the meaning of § 1512(c)(2) means acting with an improper
## purpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert,
## impede or obstruct” the relevant proceeding. United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 (10th
## Cir. 2013) (some quotation marks omitted). The majority opinion in Aguilar did not address the
## defendant’s vagueness challenge to the word “corruptly,” 515 U.S. at 600 n. 1, but Justice Scalia’s
## separate opinion did reach that issue and would have rejected the challenge, id. at 616-617 (Scalia,
## J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). “Statutory
## language need not be colloquial,” Justice Scalia explained, and “the term ‘corruptly’ in criminal
## laws has a longstanding and well-accepted meaning. It denotes an act done with an intent to give
## some advantage inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.” Id. at 616 (internal
## quotation marks omitted; citing lower court authority and legal dictionaries). Justice Scalia added
## that “in the context of obstructing jury proceedings, any claim of ignorance of wrongdoing is
## incredible.” Id. at 617. Lower courts have also rejected vagueness challenges to the word
## “corruptly.” See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 869 F.3d 490, 501-502 (7th Cir. 2017); United
## States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1280-1281 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d
## 1331, 1336 n.9 (5th Cir. 1978). This well-established intent standard precludes the need to limit
## the obstruction statutes to only certain kinds of inherently wrongful conduct.1083
## 
## 
##        1083
##            In United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the court of appeals found the
## term “corruptly” in 18 U.S.C. § 1505 vague as applied to a person who provided false information to
## Congress. After suggesting that the word “corruptly” was vague on its face, 951 F.2d at 378, the court
## 
##                                                  166
##                                  U.S. Department of Justice
##      Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)
## 
## 
## 
##         c. Finally, the rule of lenity does not justify treating Section 1512(c)(2) as a prohibition on
## evidence impairment, as opposed to an omnibus clause. The rule of lenity is an interpretive
## principle that resolves ambiguity in criminal laws in favor of the less-severe construction.
## Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000). “[A]s [the Court has] repeatedly emphasized,”
## however, the rule of lenity applies only if, “after considering text, structure, history and purpose,
## there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply
## guess as to what Congress intended.” Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 188 n.10 (2014)
## (internal quotation marks omitted). The rule has been cited, for example, in adopting a narrow
## meaning of “tangible object” in an obstruction statute when the prohibition’s title, history, and list
## of prohibited acts indicated a focus on destruction of records. See Yates v. United States, 135 S.
## Ct. 1074, 1088 (2015) (plurality opinion) (interpreting “tangible object” in the phrase “record,
## document, or tangible object” in 18 U.S.C. § 1519 to mean an item capable of recording or
## preserving information). Here, as discussed above, the text, structure, and history of Section
## 1512(c)(2) leaves no “grievous ambiguity” about the statute’s meaning. Section 1512(c)(2)
## defines a structurally independent general prohibition on obstruction of official proceedings.
## 
##                    5. Other Obstruction Statutes Might Apply to the Conduct in this Investigation
## 
##         Regardless whether Section 1512(c)(2) covers all corrupt acts that obstruct, influence, or
## impede pending or contemplated proceedings, other statutes would apply to such conduct in
## pending proceedings, provided that the remaining statutory elements are satisfied. As discussed
## above, the omnibus clause in 18 U.S.C. § 1503(a) applies generally to obstruction of pending
## judicial and grand proceedings.1084 See Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 598 (noting that the clause is “far
## more general in scope” than preceding provisions). Section 1503(a)’s protections extend to
## witness tampering and to other obstructive conduct that has a nexus to pending proceedings. See
## Sampson, 898 F.3d at 298-303 &amp; n.6 (collecting cases from eight circuits holding that Section
## 1503 covers witness-related obstructive conduct, and cabining prior circuit authority). And
## Section 1505 broadly criminalizes obstructive conduct aimed at pending agency and congressional
## proceedings.1085 See, e.g., United States v. Rainey, 757 F.3d 234, 241-247 (5th Cir. 2014).
## 
## 
## 
## concluded that the statute did not clearly apply to corrupt conduct by the person himself and the “core”
## conduct to which Section 1505 could constitutionally be applied was one person influencing another person
## to violate a legal duty. Id. at 379-386. Congress later enacted a provision overturning that result by
## providing that “[a]s used in [S]ection 1505, the term ‘corruptly’ means acting with an improper purpose,
## personally or by influencing another, including by making a false or misleading statement, or withholding,
## concealing, altering, or destroying a document or other information.” 18 U.S.C. § 1515(b). Other courts
## have declined to follow Poindexter either by limiting it to Section 1505 and the specific conduct at issue in
## that case, see Brenson, 104 F.3d at 1280-1281; reading it as narrowly limited to certain types of conduct,
## see United States v. Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 629-630 (D.C. Cir. 1996); or by noting that it predated Arthur
## Andersen’s interpretation of the term “corruptly,” see Edwards, 869 F.3d at 501-502.
##         1084
##                Section 1503(a) provides for criminal punishment of:
##                           Whoever . . . corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or
##                    communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or
##                    impede, the due administration of justice.
##         1085
##                Section 1505 provides for criminal punishment of:
